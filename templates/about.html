            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Yatrik began with a simple idea — you should always know where your bus is and when it will arrive. What started as a tool to help friends coordinate long-distance trips has grown into a platform serving thousands of routes across India.</p>
            <p>Today, we partner with verified operators and leverage modern technology to provide reliable real-time information so you can travel with confidence.</p>
